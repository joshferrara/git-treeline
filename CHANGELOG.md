## [0.28.0]

- **`gtl env`** — print the current worktree's environment. Default output shows every key from the env file, with Treeline-managed keys annotated `[treeline]`. `--json` for structured output. `--template` shows unresolved interpolation tokens instead of final values.
- **Port conflict detection on reuse** — `gtl setup` now checks `IsPortFree` when reusing an existing allocation. If any port is occupied (e.g. another process grabbed it since last allocation), Treeline automatically re-allocates to a free block, updates the registry, and prints a warning. Treeline never hands back a port it cannot actually use.
- **Shell completions** — `gtl completion bash|zsh|fish|powershell` outputs completion scripts. Homebrew installs completions automatically. Dynamic completions added for `gtl config get/set` (common config keys) and `gtl status --project` (project names).
- **`gtl start --await`** — blocks until the server is accepting TCP connections on its allocated port, then exits 0. Designed for agents and CI scripts that need to wait for readiness before hitting the server. `--await-timeout` sets the deadline in seconds (default 60). Works on both fresh start and resume (when the supervisor is already running).
- **`gtl open`** — opens the current worktree in the browser. Prefers `https://{project}-{branch}.localhost` when `gtl serve` is running; falls back to `http://localhost:{port}`. Always opens the primary port.
- **`gtl clone`** — clone a repo and set up Treeline in one step. Passes all flags through to `git clone`, detects the framework, generates `.treeline.yml` if absent, and runs `gtl setup`. Deliberately does not auto-start — cloning a foreign repo and running arbitrary shell commands is a trust boundary.
- **Lifecycle hooks** — `.treeline.yml` now supports `pre_setup`, `post_setup`, `pre_release`, and `post_release` hooks. Pre-hooks abort the operation on failure; post-hooks warn and continue. Hook ordering: allocate → env → DB → `pre_setup` → `commands.setup` → editor → `post_setup`. Release: confirm → `pre_release` → free/drop → `post_release`.
- **`gtl resolve`** — look up another worktree's URL by project name. Uses same-branch matching by default: if your frontend and API repos both have `feature-auth` checked out, `{resolve:api}` in an env template resolves to `http://127.0.0.1:{api-port}` automatically. Override with `gtl resolve api staging` or `{resolve:api/staging}` in templates. Supports `--json` for scripting.
- **`gtl link` / `gtl unlink`** — runtime resolve overrides stored in the registry. `gtl link api staging` redirects all `{resolve:api}` lookups to the `staging` branch instead of the same-branch default. Survives restarts and `gtl refresh`. Visible in `gtl status` and `gtl doctor`. Use `--restart` to bounce the supervised server after linking. `gtl unlink api` reverts to the default.
- **`{resolve:project}` interpolation** — new env template token. Resolved at setup time using the registry. Supports `{resolve:project}` (same-branch default) and `{resolve:project/branch}` (explicit branch). Fails setup with a clear error if the target is not allocated.
- **Links visibility** — `gtl status` and `gtl doctor` now display active link overrides for each worktree.

## [0.27.0]

- **`gtl share`** — private branch sharing via token-gated URLs. Creates a Cloudflare tunnel fronted by an auth proxy: the recipient opens the link, gets a session cookie, and sees clean URLs from there. Tokens are ephemeral — new token and tunnel hostname on every run, everything destroyed on Ctrl+C. Uses your configured domain when a named tunnel is available; falls back to `*.trycloudflare.com` otherwise.
- **`gtl share --tailscale`** — alternative Tailscale Serve backend for tailnet-only sharing. No tokens needed — Tailscale handles identity-based auth with WireGuard encryption. Only people on your tailnet can reach the URL. Detects Tailscale from PATH or the macOS app bundle. Mutually exclusive with `--tunnel`.
- **Multi-tunnel config** — store multiple named tunnel configurations with a default, like rbenv. `gtl tunnel setup` now adds to your tunnel list; `gtl tunnel default <name>` switches the active config. Both `gtl tunnel` and `gtl share` accept `--tunnel <name>` to override the default. Old single-tunnel configs (`tunnel.name`/`tunnel.domain`) are auto-migrated.

## [0.26.0]

- **`--json` everywhere** — `gtl doctor`, `gtl port`, and `gtl db name` now accept `--json` for structured output. `gtl status --json` auto-probes port listening and supervisor state without requiring `--check`.
- **`gtl new` shows serve URL** — after creating a worktree, `gtl new` prints the HTTPS router URL when `gtl serve` is running, matching the behavior of `gtl setup`.
- **Tunnel host hints** — `gtl tunnel` detects the project framework and prints the exact config change needed to whitelist the tunnel domain. Covers Rails (`config.hosts`), Vite (`server.allowedHosts`), and Django (`ALLOWED_HOSTS`). Named tunnels show the wildcard for your domain; quick tunnels suggest `.trycloudflare.com`.

## [0.25.0]

- **AI agent integration** — git-treeline now speaks MCP (Model Context Protocol). Add it to your editor's MCP config and agents can query allocations, check health, read config, get database names, and control the dev server — all via structured JSON. Exposes 9 tools and 2 resources.
- **Config rename** — `ports_needed` renamed to `port_count`. Existing configs are auto-migrated on load with a deprecation warning.

## [0.21.0]

- **Editor auto-detection** — `gtl init` detects which editor is running (Cursor, VS Code, Zed, JetBrains products) via terminal env vars or PATH probing, and stores `editor.name` in user config. Used by the menulet for "Open in Editor" labels. Falls back gracefully — if detection fails, no name is stored and the menulet hides the link.
- **Editor customization** — new `editor.title`, `editor.color`, and `editor.theme` config in `.treeline.yml` replace the old `editor.vscode_title`. Auto-migrated on first load.
  - `title`: window title template with `{project}`, `{port}`, `{branch}` interpolation
  - `color`: title/status/activity bar color — `"auto"` generates a deterministic color from the branch name, or set an explicit hex value. User config overrides via `editor.colors` in `config.json`.
  - `theme`: full IDE theme override (e.g. `"Monokai"`). User config overrides via `editor.themes` in `config.json`.
- **Workspace file detection** — when a `.code-workspace` file references the worktree, editor settings are written there (required for multi-root workspaces in VS Code/Cursor). Falls back to `.vscode/settings.json` for single-folder projects.
- **JetBrains support** — if `.idea/` exists, `editor.color` sets the project header color in `workspace.xml` (JetBrains 2023.2+).
- **User-level editor overrides** — `config.json` supports `editor.themes` and `editor.colors` maps keyed by `project` or `project/branch` for per-repo or per-branch IDE customization.
- **Port reservations** — pin stable ports to projects or specific branches via `port.reservations` in user config. Project-level keys (`salt: 3000`) apply to the main repo; `project/branch` keys (`salt/staging: 3020`) pin a specific branch and take priority. Reserved ports block the full `port.increment` range so dynamic allocations never collide.
- **`gtl refresh`** — re-allocate all registered worktrees with current config and reservations in one shot. Supervised servers are restarted automatically; manually-started servers are flagged for manual restart. Supports `--dry-run` and `--force`.
- **`gtl port`** — prints the allocated port for the current worktree. Designed for agents and scripts that need the port without parsing status output.
- **`AGENTS.md` integration** — `gtl init` now writes a treeline section to `AGENTS.md` (works with Cursor, Claude Code, and Codex) instead of `.cursor/rules/treeline.mdc`. Appends to existing `AGENTS.md` or `CLAUDE.md`, or creates `AGENTS.md` if neither exists. Includes `gtl port` as the primary port discovery instruction.
- **Reservation-aware reuse** — `gtl setup` now detects when an existing allocation's port doesn't match a reservation (or conflicts with another project's reservation) and automatically re-allocates instead of reusing stale ports.
- **Fix: stale port reuse** — re-running `gtl setup` after changing `port_count` in config now correctly re-allocates instead of reusing the old port count.
- **Fix: `ProjectDefaults` env_file** — defaults now use the string shorthand form, matching the canonical config shape.
- **Self-documenting templates** — `gtl init` generates `.treeline.yml` with commented-out optional config (port_count, Redis, editor, etc.) so available features are discoverable without reading docs. `port_count: 2` is never auto-emitted as active config.

## [0.19.0]

### New

- **`gtl switch`** — switch a worktree to a different branch or PR in one step. Accepts branch names or PR numbers (resolved via `gh`). Fetches from origin, checks out the branch, updates the registry, and refreshes the env file. Use `--setup` to re-run `commands.setup` after switching.
- **`gtl doctor`** — check project config, allocation, runtime, and diagnostics in one view. Reports on `.treeline.yml` presence, env file status, port allocation, supervisor state, and framework-specific guidance.
- **Tab completion** — `gtl new`, `gtl review`, and `gtl switch` now provide shell completions for branch names and PR numbers.
- **`gtl release` confirmation** — single-worktree releases now show what will be released and prompt for confirmation. Use `--force` to skip.
- **Worktree guard** — `gtl new` and `gtl review` now error if run from inside a worktree (which would create confusing sibling worktrees). Suggests `gtl switch` or navigating to the main repo instead.

### Changed

- **Simplified `env_file` config** — `env_file: .env.local` now works as a string shorthand (replaces the old `target:`/`source:` map). For cases where the written file differs from the seed, use `path:`/`seed_from:`. Old configs are auto-migrated on first load.
- Templates now emit the simplified `env_file` string form.

## [0.18.0]

### New

- **`gtl start` injects env vars** — the supervisor now reads the worktree's allocation from the registry, resolves env templates from `.treeline.yml`, and passes them into the child process environment. `PORT`, `DATABASE_URL`, etc. are available as real env vars without requiring the app to read `.env` files.
- **Vite detection** — `gtl init` recognizes Vite projects (`vite.config.js/ts/mjs`) and generates a tailored `.treeline.yml` with `npx vite` start command and `.env.local` wiring
- **Post-init/setup diagnostics** — `gtl init` and `gtl setup` now print actionable warnings:
  - Vite: explains `vite.config.js` + `loadEnv` port wiring
  - Node without dotenv: warns that `.env` won't be auto-read, suggests install
  - Python without python-dotenv: same pattern
  - Go/Rust: suggests sourcing env file in start command
  - Missing `env_file` block when `env` vars are configured
- **Smarter env_file emission** — templates now emit `env_file` for frameworks that natively load env files (Next.js, Vite, Rails) even when no `.env` file exists yet on disk
- **dotenv detection** — detects `dotenv`, `dotenv-cli`, `python-dotenv`, `django-environ` in dependency files

## [0.17.0]

### Breaking

- `setup_commands` → `commands.setup` and `start_command` → `commands.start` in `.treeline.yml`
- Auto-migration: existing configs with old keys are rewritten on first load — no manual cleanup needed
- Generated templates now include `commands.start` per framework (Next.js, Rails, Node, Python)

## [0.16.0]

- `gtl start` / `gtl stop` / `gtl restart` — supervised dev server
  - `start` runs `start_command` from `.treeline.yml` under a Unix socket supervisor
  - `stop` pauses the server; supervisor stays alive for resume
  - `start` (again) resumes the server in the original terminal
  - `restart` atomic bounce — stop + start in one step
  - Ctrl+C in the terminal fully exits the supervisor
- Hardened supervisor: socket permissions (0600), read deadlines, `sync.Once` on shutdown, 30s client timeout

## [0.15.0]

- `gtl db` command group for worktree database management:
  - `db name` — print the worktree's database name
  - `db reset` — drop and re-clone from template
  - `db reset --from <db>` — clone from a different local database
  - `db restore <file>` — restore from pg_dump (auto-detects custom format vs plain SQL)
  - `db drop` — drop without re-cloning
- Document port-dependent data pattern (setup_commands for OAuth/webhook fixups)

## [0.14.1]

- Homebrew: `gtl` alias available via `brew install git-treeline`

## [0.14.0]

- Fix incorrect Next.js PORT documentation
- Drop git-treeline-rails gem reference

## [0.13.0]

### Breaking

- Rename `default_branch` → `merge_target` in `.treeline.yml`
- Auto-migration: existing configs with `default_branch` are rewritten to `merge_target` on first load — no manual cleanup needed
- If both keys exist, `merge_target` wins and `default_branch` is silently removed

## [0.12.0]

- Smarter env file detection: `init` finds which env file actually exists (`.env.local`, `.env.development`, `.env`, etc.) instead of hardcoding per framework
- Interactive env file selection: confirms single match, prompts to choose when multiple found
- Framework-specific port wiring hints printed after `init` (Next.js, Node, Python)
- Port guidance included in generated agent context files (`treeline.mdc`, `CLAUDE.md`)

## [0.11.0]

- Add `registry.UpdateField()` for lock-safe single-field updates
- Reuse detected branch in editor title config (eliminates redundant git call)

## [0.10.0]

- Add merge target config field: `prune --merged` now works with any target branch (develop, staging, trunk, etc.)
